# Project 3 FYS-STK4155

We will do image classification using the "Fruit Recognition" dataset found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/fruit-recognition?select=Apple

We will exclude several categories, to avoid the computational load and excessive training. The data set we will use will be found on the google disk of helenewo@uio.no. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x4OtUsZP8ghEzeJ4rRSojOQihxhwp7cU?usp=sharing)

If this does not work, send an email to helenewo@uio.no to ask for the dataset in an other way.

## The Repository
